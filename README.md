RC1600 CPU prototype

Specs : https://gist.github.com/Zardoz89/6240295

Actually only executes instruccions from a hardcoded program in a array. Each tinme that you press any key, executes one instrucction.
I dont did yet a online dissaambler, but you could see the all registers, and what instrucction hex code was executed.

Actually I have implemented the mayority of ALU operations (not yet MUL/DIV/MOD), LOAD/STORE instrucctions, and a bit few other instrucctions.
