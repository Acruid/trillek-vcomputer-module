RC3200 Computer Virtual Machine
===============================

Using this [specs](https://github.com/Zardoz89/Trillek-Computer)

COMPILING
---------
Actually I'm using CMake, and I need SFML for graphics/events/timing

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
 
If all it's OK, should generate a executable called **vm**, and in ./src/ should be created static and shared libs of the VM core.
